## Background
### Problem Statement

This project aims to predict individual’s smoking and drinking habits using their health metrics. The dataset is provided by the 
National Health Insurance Service in Korea and contains a wide range of health indicators, including height, weight, waistline, 
blood pressure readings, cholesterol levels, and liver enzyme readings. By analyzing this data, we aim to determine the impact 
of smoking/drinking on these health metrics of the individual.


### Potential Real-world applications

**Health Risk Assessment:**  By analyzing the correlation between health metrics and smoking/drinking habits, healthcare professionals can 
develop more precise risk assessment tools. These tools can predict the likelihood of certain health complications based on an individual's 
habits and physiological measurements. 

**Public Health Campaigns:** Governments and health organizations can utilize the findings to design personalized health interventions and 
public health campaigns. For instance, those who smoke and show specific detrimental health metrics can receive targeted advice and resources 
to quit smoking. 

**Insurance Premium Calculation:** Insurance companies can use this data to adjust health insurance premiums based on the risk associated with 
smoking and drinking habits. Those who smoke or drink might face higher premiums, incentivizing healthier lifestyle choices.

**Health tracking wearables:** Companies developing wearable health technologies, like smartwatches that monitor various health metrics, 
can integrate these models trained from these datasets to provide users with real-time feedback on the potential health impacts of their habits.


### Research Questions
- Is smoking and drinking really independent of each other? Do all drinkers smoke or Do all smokers drink?
- Is it true that the majority of drinkers/smokers are men? What percent of smokers or drinkers are women?
- What age groups do the majority of smokers/drinkers belong to?
- What are some key health indicators (features) that correlate with smoking and/or drinking habits?
- How do different machine learning techniques (linear vs. non-linear) compare in the identification of smoking & drinking habits based on their health parameters and which models can most accurately classify individuals?
- As per the best performing models, which features are most important for identifying smoking status or drinking status?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed in order to understand the data, answer the research questions and get some insights

- df.shape : Shape of the data - 991346 rows and 24 columns
- df.dtypes : To check the data types of all columns
- df.duplicated() : There are 26 duplicate rows
- df.isna() : To check the null values. There are no null values in any column

### Distribution Histogram

This is a Histogram for all the columns of the dataset

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/histogram_all.png">

### Drinking State

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/drinking_count.png">

The data has almost equal number of drinkers and non-drinkers

### Smoking State

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/smoking_count.png">

Majority of the data shows non-smokers, followed by smokers and then those who quit smoking

### Is smoking and drinking really independent of each other? Do all drinkers smoke or Do all smokers drink?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/smoking_vs_drinking.png">

From the above plot, we can see that:
- Majority of the non-drinkers are non-smokers
- While majority of drinkers are non smokers, the gap between each of the smoking state is less
- The number of drinkers who smoke are approximately three times the number of non-drinkers who smoke

### Is it true that the majority of drinkers/smokers are men? What percent of smokers or drinkers are women?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/gender_vs_drinking.png">

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/gender_vs_smoking.png">

From the above plot, we can see that:

- Approximately 70% of the drinkers are male
- Non-drinking female is almost twice the number of non-drinking male
- Majority of the non-smokers are female
- Male population dominates in both the states of still smoking and quit smoking

### What age groups do the majority of smokers/drinkers belong to?¶

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/age_drinking.png">

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/age_smoking.png">

- Most of the smokers are between 35 and 50 years
- Most of the drinkers are between 30 and 50 years

### What are some key health indicators (features) that correlate with smoking and/or drinking habits?¶

To answer this question, we need to see the correlation matrix to see the inter relation between columns.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gunda18/UMBC-DATA606-FALL2023-TUESDAY/blob/main/ref_pics/correlation.png">

## Model Training

- As the objective is to predict if a person is smoking or not and if a person is drinking or not, we are going to use classification models
- For model training, the data is split into two parts:
  - 70% of the data is used for training the models - 693,924 rows
  - 30% of the data is used for testing the models - 297,396 rows
- As two kinds of predictions are done here, models are trained seperately for drinking and smoking
- The models to be trained are:
  - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting

## Application of the Trained Models - Streamlit Web Application

- Developed a web application using streamlit.
- The streamlit web page contains several areas of input where the user is asked to enter the values like height, weight, eye sight, cholestrol etc.
- Once the input is given, the user should select if they want to predict smoking or drinking.
- When submitted, the result will be displayed below the submit button.

## 7. Conclusion

### Summary of Project
In summary, this project embarked on the journey of predicting smoking and drinking habits based on health metrics. Leveraging a diverse dataset, we delved into the intricacies of the relationships between various health indicators and these habits. Through meticulous exploratory data analysis and model training, we aimed to provide actionable insights for various stakeholders.

### Potential Applications
The application of our predictive models spans across multiple domains. From healthcare professionals using more precise risk assessment tools to governments designing targeted public health campaigns, the implications are far-reaching. Insurance companies can benefit from adjusting premiums based on accurate risk assessments, and individuals can receive personalized feedback through health tracking wearables.

### Limitations
It's essential to acknowledge the limitations of our work. The predictions provided by the models are based on correlations observed in the dataset and may not imply causation. Furthermore, the accuracy of predictions relies heavily on the quality and representativeness of the dataset.

### Lessons Learned
Throughout the project, we learned valuable lessons in data preprocessing, model selection, and the importance of interpretability. The agile approach allowed us to adapt to challenges and refine our models continuously.
