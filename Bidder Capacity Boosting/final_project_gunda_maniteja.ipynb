    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "An FMCG company has a manufacturing unit in Baltimore, MD. They produce 100,000 units every week and this product is consumed throughout the state of Maryland. The company does not have any transportation wing. So, they organize an auction once every financial quarter. In this auction, several transportation companies place their bid. The bid includes transportation capacity, which means how many cases the bidder can ship (each case contains 10 units) and transportation cost (cost per case)."

    "## Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The manufacturing company wants to minimize their expenditure on transportation. It is not as simple as selecting the transporters that bid the least transportation cost. The company values their relationship with previous transporters/bidders and also wants to engage with new bidders. So, there is a need for a tool that optimizes bidder selection based on the cost, number of previous contracts and also new bidders."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is built based on the concepts of data structures and object-oriented programming. A class is created with several methods that manages bidder data. Once the data is available. Heap sort is utilized to allocate cases to each bidder. The data is stored in a dataframe. The dataframe consists of 4 columns:\n",
    "- Bidder: Name of the bidder\n",
    "- Capacity: Number of cases bidder can transport\n",
    "- Cost: Cost of transportation per case\n",
    "- History: Number of previous successful bids"

    "The methods in the Bid_Manager class are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**load_data()**: This method is to load the csv file if working on existing data.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**save_data()**: This method is to save the main dataframe to csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**add_bidder()**: This method is used to add a new bidder. The data of the four columns is read into a dictionary and appended into the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**delete_bidder()**: This method is used to delete a bidder. The bidder to be deleted is selected. The location of the bidder is searched in the dataframe and the whole row is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**edit_bidder()**: This method is used to edit the bidder data. Once the bidder is selected, the values are edited in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**new_bidder_split()**: As we need to consider past bidder relationship and also encourage new bidders, we need this method to dynamically allocate cases to new and old bidders. For example, if we call this method with 70 as value, 70% of total available cases will be assigned to old bidders and 30% cases to new bidders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**weighted_criteria()**: As we need to consider past bidder relationship while allocating cases, we need this method to weight each criterion. For example, if we call this method with 50, 30, 20 as values, 50% of the weight is given to Cost, 30% to History and 20% to capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**allocate()**: This method is the core of this project. It uses either sorting or optimizing algorithms to distribute cases among the bidders. This method is called twice, once with old bidders and then with new bidders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**validate_allocation()**: This method will check if the allocation is done properly by verifying if the total number of allocated cases matches the initial total cases. Also, this function calculates and displays the total cost of transportation."
